MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost/ecommerce
```

This codebase includes:

* A Node.js backend using Express.js, with routes for products, users, and orders
* A React frontend that displays a list of products, allows users to add/remove products from their cart, and displays the cart contents
* A MongoDB database to store products, users, and orders
* A `.env` file to configure the MongoDB connection

To run the application, navigate to the backend directory and run `npm start` to start the server. Then, navigate to the frontend directory and run `npm start` to start the React development server. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.

Note that this is a basic implementation and you may want to add additional features, such as user authentication, payment processing, and error handling.
